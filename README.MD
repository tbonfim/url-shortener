# URL Shortener

This is an application that allows users to shorten URLs and navigate to the original URLs. This is a Node.js based application, with Express and React. 

# Requirements

 1.  A user should be able to load the index page of your site and be presented with an input field where they can enter a URL. 
 2.  Upon entering the URL, a "shortened" version of that URL is created and shown to the user as a URL to the site you're building.
 3. When visiting that "shortened" version of the URL, the user is redirected to the original URL.
 4.  Additionally, if a URL has already been shortened by the system, and it is entered a second time, the first shortened URL should be given back to the user.

# Tech details

On the server-side of the app, I used an external database to keep track of the shortened URL - hosted on `mongoDB` cloud and used `Mongoose` to make the connection in the app. I also used the npm package `shortid` to generate the shorten URL slugs, and `isUrl` package to help to validate the input. `Jest` was used to build the server-side tests.
On the client-side there's a simple `React` app generated by `Create-React-App` that communicates to the server-side using `Axios` via REST.  `React testing library`was used to build the client-side tests.

# Running
To run this up, you need to have the latest version of `Node` installed. 
First, open your terminal on the root folder and run: `npm install` to install the server-side dependencies. 
Then you will need to run `cd client && npm install` to install the client app.
Once you completed both installations, go back to the root level and run `npm start`. 
At this point, you should see the application running in a new tab( if that doesn't work, you can open it by accessing http://localhost:3000/) . You should be good to start playing!

# Tests
Tests are split into server-side and client-side tests. 
## Server-side
To run the server-side tests you need to make sure you have `Jest` installed. If you don't have it, run 
`npm install -g jest` to install it globally.
On the root level, run `npm run test:server`	
## Client-side
First, you need to have the server-side app running to make sure you won't see any exceptions and errors on the tests, so, on the root level, run `npm run server`. In another terminal tab, to run the server-side tests, run `npm run test:client`.

# Notes
There's plenty of room for improvements in this project, especially in the presentation to the user. This is a work in progress project! Any feedback is always welcome.
